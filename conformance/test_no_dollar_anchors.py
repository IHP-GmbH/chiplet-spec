"""No schema regular expression ends in ``$``.

Under Python ``re`` a trailing ``$`` also matches before a final newline, so a
pattern anchored with it accepts ``"value\n"`` while the reference readers refuse
it (SPEC-11). The portable end anchor is ``(?![\\s\\S])``. This walks EVERY
committed schema and collects every regular expression it carries, both
``pattern`` values and ``patternProperties`` keys, because a grep for the word
``pattern`` missed the keys twice in one day. The list is derived, not
hand-maintained: a new schema or a new pattern is covered the moment it is
committed.

What this does not cover: patterns in prose, and regular expressions compiled in
the reference readers themselves (those are pinned by their own case tests).
The two policing tests are complements, not overlaps: a pattern that regresses
to ``$`` is caught by the dollar test and SKIPPED by the newline test (it is no
longer end-anchored in the recognised way). Never trim the dollar test.
