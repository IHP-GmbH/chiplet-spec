"""Gate for validation rule 9: component connection -> method -> interface type.

Rule 9 is the cross-artifact half of SPEC-22. Rule 8 relates a pad's usage class
to an interface type inside one document; rule 9 relates the interconnect METHOD
a component selects through ``connection:`` to the type of the interfaces that
component takes part in, and the method's ``interface_type`` lives in the
interconnect manifest, not in the ``.chiplet``. Neither reference validator holds
a manifest, so neither runs it. What this file gates is therefore the CONTRACT
around the rule, not the rule: that the spec states it as an assembly-stage rule
and names its owners, that the corpus carries the single oracle those owners
parity-test against, and that the oracle is a document the reference readers
accept, which is the measured fact that makes the gap visible instead of
invisible.

What a green here does NOT cover (META-2), and the list is the point:

* the rule itself. Nothing in this repository resolves a method id to an
  ``interface_type``, so no green here is evidence that any inconsistent binding
  is ever refused. The refusals are owned by the KiCad plugin (at export),
  adk-tools' assembly DRC, the Mosaic loader and chiplet-system (at load), and
  each owes a parity test against the oracle fixture in its own suite. Rows open
  per host; until those land, rule 9 is written down and unenforced.
* the CONSISTENT case. The corpus carries one inconsistent binding, not a pair;
  a host that refuses every binding would pass against this file alone.
* the message a host emits, and whether it names what the spec says it names.
* the geometry behind the binding: rule 9 compares two identifiers' declared
  types and says nothing about the stack, the pads or the pitch.
* whether ``examples/interconnect_methods.json`` yet carries ``interface_type``
  at all. It does not (that is FUT-4, at interconnect_pdk); the assertion that
  the registry contradicts the document arms itself when the field lands.
