"""Executable gate for the top-level block grammar and its oracle.

The grammar is normative in docs/CHIPLET_FORMAT_SPEC.md ("Top-level block
grammar"): which run of lines belongs to which top-level key, decided on the raw
text. Flow rule 4 (a host re-emits a flow block it did not author byte for byte)
is defined in terms of it, so three implementations run the SAME oracle file
rather than being compared to each other: the merge splitter in the KiCad plugin,
the Python reference reader, and the C++ reference reader.

This file proves the oracle is well formed and that the Python reference obeys it.
The C++ side reads the same file from its own test binary.

#: "\\x85" and NOT PyYAML's "\\N", which is the spelling PyYAML would pick on its
#: own: measured on PyYAML 6.0.3 and yaml-cpp 0.8.0, a scalar written "a\\Nb" reads
#: back as 61 c2 85 62 here and as 61 85 62 there, a BARE 0x85 that is not valid
#: UTF-8 by itself, so our own escape handed the other reference reader a
#: malformed string. "\\x85" and "\\u0085" both decode to U+0085 in the two.
