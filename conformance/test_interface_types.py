"""Executable gate for the closed interfaces[].type vocabulary (rule 4, SPEC-23).

The vocabulary is written down four times: the enum in
``schemas/chiplet.schema.json``, the prose list in ``docs/CHIPLET_FORMAT_SPEC.md``,
``kKnownInterfaceTypes`` in the C++ reference source, and
``chiplet_format_io.KNOWN_INTERFACE_TYPES``. Four copies of one list is how a
member ends up accepted by one reader and refused by the other, which is the
state SPEC-23 found: the C++ reader threw on an unknown type, the Python
validator accepted it, and the spec carried an italic exception saying so. This
file reads all four and compares them, and then exercises the Python validator's
behaviour, which no text comparison can show.

What a green here does NOT cover (META-2): the C++ reader's BEHAVIOUR on each
member (its own test binary owns that, test_every_known_interface_type_is_accepted);
whether any producer emits ``solder_bump`` (none may before format 1.1, see
docs/VERSION_POLICY.md's sweep table); and which io_class a given type may meet,
which is rule 8 and lives in test_pad_usage_compatibility.py.
