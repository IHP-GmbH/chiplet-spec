"""chiplet_format_io -- permissive reference reader/writer for the .chiplet format.

Apache-2.0. Dependency-clean: depends only on PyYAML. It deliberately does NOT
import ``pcbnew`` or ``klayout`` (or any GPL library), so it can be embedded in
tools under any license, open-source or proprietary.

This is an INDEPENDENT reference implementation of the format described in
``docs/CHIPLET_FORMAT_SPEC.md``. It is intentionally *not* the byte-exact writer
used inside the GPL host tools (the KiCad plugin / KiCad fork exporter): those are
locked to each other by a byte-exact parity gate. Output here is canonical YAML,
semantically equivalent, not byte-identical to those hosts.

Typical use::

    import chiplet_format_io as cfio
    assembly = cfio.load("design.chiplet")      # -> dict, validated
    assembly["assembly"]["name"] = "renamed"
    cfio.dump(assembly, "design.chiplet")

Version policy (docs/VERSION_POLICY.md). One rule governs every versioned
artifact in the format family: a consumer declares the SET of majors it accepts
with one MAJOR.MINOR floor each (a single string is the one-element set); a
declared version whose major is in the set is accepted when its minor is at or
below that major's floor and accepted with a warning when it is higher; a major
outside the set or a malformed value is refused; PATCH is ignored.
:func:`check_format_version` applies it to a ``.chiplet``'s own
``format_version``; :func:`check_contract_version` applies it to any governed
sidecar (``io_pads.json``, ``pins.json``, the black-box padmap, the boundary
manifest, ``interconnect_methods.json``)::

    cfio.check_contract_version(doc["version"], "1.0", name="io_pads.json")

The warn channel, stated once because two references have to mean the same thing
by it. ``on_warn`` is the single NORMATIVE channel: every event, undeduplicated,
in the order it happened, and it is what a consumer counts or gates on.
Everything else this library does with a note is non-normative CONVENIENCE and
may change without a format version moving: the stdlib ``warnings`` emission
here (deduplicated per version, and a process-global the host configures) and
``ChipletDocument::warnings`` on the C++ side. A consumer that needs the events
sets ``on_warn``.

Two version constants, and they answer different questions.
:data:`SUPPORTED_FORMAT_VERSION` is the highest ``.chiplet`` ``format_version``
this reader was written for, i.e. a fact about documents. :data:`__version__` is
the release of the reader itself, and it is the value a VENDORED copy of this
file carries into the tool that embedded it. That is what makes byte identity
unnecessary: a consumer requires a reader release (``cfio.__version__``) and a
document version, and never has to hash a copied file to find out what it has.

SUPPORTED_FORMAT_VERSION = "1.0"

#: The SET of majors this reader accepts, one ``MAJOR.MINOR`` floor per major

#: reads all four, so a member added to one alone fails there instead of
#: travelling. It is the vocabulary a WRITER is bound to and the list a consumer
#: reads to decide what it can act on; this reader does not refuse a string
#: outside it, it carries the value and reports the event on ``on_warn``.

#: The code points a YAML parser breaks a line on and THIS GRAMMAR does not,
#: mapped to the name a refusal quotes. That criterion is what GENERATES the set,
#: and it is executable: conformance/test_top_level_blocks.py derives the members
#: by running PyYAML over U+0000..U+21FF instead of trusting this list, because a
#: hand-written derived list is exactly how CR came to be missing from it for one
#: release. The grammar is what SPEC-14's repeated-key scan, flow rule 4,
#: top_level_blocks() and every splitting host read, so a character that moves a
#: line for the parser and not for the grammar hides a top-level key from all of
#: them at once.
#:
#: For these three, membership is unconditional. CR is the fourth member and the
#: only conditional one, so it is kept out of this mapping and checked on its own:
#: CRLF is the format's other line break, so a CR is ill-formed exactly when the
#: byte after it is not LF. Every consumer of the mapping below means "anywhere".
#:
#: Measured in both directions on PyYAML 6.0.3 and yaml-cpp 0.8.0: with
#: `name: demo<LS>` followed by `format_version: "9.0"`, PyYAML reads a second
#: top-level key and returns format_version '9.0' while yaml-cpp throws "illegal
#: map value"; with the same separator followed by ordinary text, yaml-cpp loads
#: the bytes inside the scalar and PyYAML throws a ScannerError. CR behaves the
#: same way in both shapes, except that yaml-cpp folds it to a space rather than
#: keeping it, so neither reader can be made to imitate the other and the format
#: refuses the bytes instead.

#
# Flow rule 4 (docs/CHIPLET_FORMAT_SPEC.md) says a host re-emits a flow block it
# did not author BYTE FOR BYTE. That is a statement about text, and it needs one
# definition of where a block starts and ends, shared by every implementation:
# the merge splitter in the KiCad plugin, this reader, and the C++ reference.
# The definition is normative in the spec under "Top-level block grammar" and
# every implementation is measured against
# conformance/fixtures/top_level_blocks_cases.json, never against another
# implementation.
#
# No YAML is parsed here, on purpose. A parsed node tree cannot answer the
# question: an emitter re-quotes scalars by its own rules (a source '0755' comes
# back bare and is an integer to the next PyYAML reader) and drops comments,
# which in a hand-written flow carry the author's intent.

#: A top-level block starts at a KEY LINE: a bare key at column zero, optionally
#: followed by whitespace and a value or a comment. Anchored with \Z, never $:
#: in Python $ also matches before a trailing newline, so a $-anchored copy of
#: this expression reads a different grammar than an ECMA-262 one does (the
#: defect adapter_id_cases.json was written for). The portable spelling of \Z is
#: (?![\s\S]); an ECMAScript implementation writes [^\n] for the dot, which

    Column zero is "does not start with a space". A tab is therefore column
    zero, deliberately: this grammar has no notion of tab indentation, and YAML
    has none either in block context (measured on PyYAML 6.0.3 and yaml-cpp
    0.8.0: both refuse a tab-indented mapping outright), so a tab-led line is
    never a line an implementation may quietly attribute to the open block.

    Five shapes at column zero are attributable and are not this:

    * a blank line (only SPACE and TAB), which belongs to its current block;
    * a comment (``#``) and a directive (``%``), on the same terms;
    * a document marker (``---``, ``...``), which stays in the current block
      (the preamble only before the first key line);
    * a BLOCK SEQUENCE ENTRY (``-`` then a space, a tab or end of line), which
      belongs to the key whose block it sits in. This one is not a nicety: it is
      how PyYAML writes every ``components:`` list this ecosystem produces, and
      a rule without it would call almost every real document unsplittable;
    * a key line, which opens a block of its own.
