## 1. What is being mapped

**3Dblox**, originated by TSMC and being standardized as **IEEE P3537**,
describes multi-die physical assemblies through three file kinds:

- **`.3dbv`** (chiplet definitions): `ChipletDef` entries with per-die
  technology, design area and thickness, named bond regions, and linkage to
  P&R views (LEF, DEF, Verilog, Liberty).
- **`.3dbx`** (the assembly): a `Design` with chiplet instances
  (`ChipletInst`, 3D placement and orientation), region-to-region
  connections, and netlist linkage.
- **`.bmap`**: per-bump maps binding individual bump instances to ports/nets.

An open-source implementation exists in **OpenROAD** (BSD-3): a multi-die
database, `read_3dbx` ingestion, an automatic assembly linter
(`check_3dblox`, seven checks: floating components, 3D overlap,
connection-region validity, bump alignment, internal-extension usage,
logical connectivity against a declared netlist, alignment markers), and a
3D viewer.

The two formats describe the **same physical-assembly layer at different
abstraction levels**. 3Dblox binds the assembly to the P&R abstraction for
multi-die EDA and design-space exploration; it references no artwork files.
`.chiplet` binds it to the mask level - GDS/OASIS bodies, `.lyp` layer
properties, per-layer interconnect metallurgy, fab DRC parameters - for
assembly signoff and fabrication hand-off. A design can usefully hold both: a
3Dblox view for exploration and P&R-level linting, a `.chiplet` for mask-level
assembly and DRC. This appendix defines the mapping between them.

## 2. Shared core

Both formats express: multi-die assemblies with a per-die technology; 2D
placement plus z; die thickness; flip / mounting orientation; die outlines;
black-box dies; assembly-level nets; and explicit units and resolution.

## 3. What 3Dblox expresses that `.chiplet` v1.0 does not

1. **Named bond regions with a side** (front / back / internal, plus an
   internal-extension variant), with coordinates and a layer.
2. **Per-bump maps** (`.bmap`) binding each bump instance to a port and net.
   (`.chiplet` carries pad *vocabulary* and interface *physics*, not a
   per-bump table.)
3. **Hierarchical sub-assemblies** (an assembly used as a component of a
   larger one; the open implementation derives a flattened "unfolded" view
   from them).
4. **Seal-ring / scribe** descriptions.
5. **Shrink** factors.
6. **Path assertions** (declared route-path checks across the assembly).
7. A **formal orientation group** (rotations by 90 degrees combined with
   mirrors). The genuinely missing delta in `.chiplet` is mirror-X /
   mirror-Y; the common cases are expressible today (`rotation.z` for
   rotations, `orientation: flip_chip` for the flipped mounting, see
   section 6).
8. **LEF / DEF / Verilog / Liberty / SDC linkage** - a non-goal for
   `.chiplet` by design; that is precisely the abstraction-level split.
9. A **linter-enforced invariant** that a connection's declared thickness
   equals the exact z gap between the connected surfaces. In `.chiplet` the
   same equality holds by construction when the z-mounting rule
   auto-calculates the die z; see section 6.1 for the explicit-z caveat.

## 4. What `.chiplet` expresses that 3Dblox does not

1. **Per-layer interconnect metallurgy** (`connection_stacks`: name,
   material, height, diameter per layer) - and a die z **derived from the
   stack**, rather than a raw scalar gap.
2. **Interconnect method identity and provenance** (the `interconnect`
   adapter/technology axis and the `interconnect_methods.json` sidecar).
3. **Fab DRC parameter linkage** (fab parameters and pitch rules feeding a
   parameterized assembly-DRC flow).
4. **Mask artwork linkage**: GDS/OASIS bodies with `.lyp` layer properties.
   3Dblox references no artwork files (its region schema carries a
   `gds_layer` layer-id attribute, which the open implementation parses and
   ignores; no field references a GDS/OASIS file).
5. **Polygonal boundary manifests** (arbitrary polygons with content hashes;
   3Dblox bond regions are 4-corner rectangles).
6. **Black-box pad vocabulary** for closed-PDK dies (pad layers usable
   without the die's own layer-properties file).
7. **Assembly-level wire-bond `io_pads`** and **typed physical interfaces**
   (`micro_bump` / `copper_pillar` / `tsv` / `wire_bond`, with pitch,
   diameter, height).
8. **`die_array`** components.
9. **Part-description linkage** (`cdxml_ref` to CDXML / JEDEC JEP30).
10. **Process-safety semantics**: the canonical coordinate frame with
    declared `anchor`, the coordinate leak guard, and the `_metadata`
    intermediate-file marker.
11. An opaque **`flow`** block for build/flow provenance.

## 5. Forward mapping (`.chiplet` -> 3Dblox), informative

A mechanical, **lossy-by-declaration** export is feasible. Field by field:

| `.chiplet` source | 3Dblox target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `die` component | `ChipletDef` (`.3dbv`) + instance (`.3dbx`) | one def per distinct die, one instance per placement |
| `dimensions.width` / `height` | design area | |
| `dimensions.thickness` | def thickness | **always** the physical thickness; never derived from any visualization stackup |
| `position` (geometric **center**) | instance placement | 3Dblox places by corner: convert center -> corner via the outline before emitting |
| `orientation: face_up` (default) | `R0` | |
| `orientation: flip_chip` | `MZ` (flipped mounting) | see section 6.3 |
| `orientation: face_down` | (none) | deliberately unmapped; an exporter must pin and verify its own convention (section 6.3) |
| `rotation.z` | `R0` / `R90` / `R180` / `R270` | **only multiples of 90 degrees**; any other angle MUST fail the export loudly, never round silently |
| `connection` stack `total_height()` | connection thickness | exact value; see section 6.1 for the explicit-z and unresolvable-connection caveats |
| die / interposer bounding boxes | front-side 4-corner bond regions | polygonal boundary detail collapses to the bbox |
| `netlist` | structural Verilog (optional) | enables the logical-connectivity lint |
| `die_array` | unrolled individual instances | |
| `technologies` entries | per-die technology | requires an external technology LEF per technology (not derivable from `.chiplet`) |
| black-box pad coordinates | candidate `.bmap` rows | each pad shape on a vocabulary layer yields one candidate row (coordinates only); bump cell type and port/net binding are not derivable from the pad vocabulary |

Flip and z-rotation compose into a **single** 3Dblox orientation value: a die
that is both flipped and rotated must be emitted as the one composed
orientation (the flipped variant of the rotation), not as two attributes. An
exporter must emit the composed value, verify pad positions per section 6.3,
and fail loudly if the target vocabulary lacks the needed combination.

**Dropped by declaration** (present in `.chiplet`, no 3Dblox target):
per-layer metallurgy (collapses to the scalar thickness), method identity and
provenance, DRC parameter linkage, GDS/OASIS + `.lyp` artwork linkage,
polygonal boundary manifests beyond the bbox, `io_pads` / typed interface
physics, `cdxml_ref`, and the `flow` block.

**External inputs an export needs**: one technology LEF per die technology;
bump masters defined in the **die's** technology (not the substrate's) for
bump-level checks. Without per-die DEFs, dies export as black boxes and the
geometric consistency lints still run.

## 6. z and orientation conventions

These are the places a naive converter produces a model that looks right
and fails the target linter (or worse, passes with wrong geometry).

### 6.1 Connection thickness is the stack height, exactly

The `.chiplet` z-mounting rule (contract, section 3) is
`z_die = mounting_surface + connection.total_height()`. The connection
stack's `total_height()` **is** the vertical gap between the attachment
surface and the die bottom. OpenROAD's linter asserts that a connection's
declared thickness equals that gap **exactly**. Therefore: emit
`thickness := connection.total_height()`, never a rounded or nominal value,
and never a gap re-derived from body outlines.

Two caveats from the contract (section 3.4). First, the equality is
guaranteed only when the die's z defers to auto-calculation; a `.chiplet`
may carry an **explicit** `position.z`, which readers honor as-is, so an
exporter MUST verify `z_die == mounting_surface + total_height()` and fail
loudly on mismatch rather than emit a thickness inconsistent with the actual
gap. Second, when a die's `connection:` id does not resolve to a stack (the
contract's fallback rows), there is no thickness source, and the export must
likewise fail loudly.

### 6.2 The attachment surface is not the maximum z

The `mounting_surface` resolves to the technology's **attachment surface**
(the pad top through the passivation opening), which is generally **not** the
substrate's maximum z: passivation can rise above the attachment surface
(in the reference interposer stackup of the contract's worked example, the
attachment surface sits at 13.83 um while the passivation top lies above
it). A converter that derives the die-to-substrate
gap from outline max-z instead of the attachment surface disagrees with
`total_height()` by the passivation height and fails the exact-equality
check. Always use the attachment-surface / stack semantics of the contract.

### 6.3 Flip is a mounting intent, not a shared mirror convention

`.chiplet`'s `orientation: flip_chip` (die mounted with its active side
toward the substrate) corresponds to 3Dblox's flipped orientation (`MZ`).
But the 2D *realization* differs between ecosystems: `.chiplet` writers
realize the flip as a layout mirror when emitting 2D views (spec,
`orientation` section), while 3Dblox composes a formal 3D orientation with a
corner anchor. An exporter must map the **intent** (`flip_chip` -> `MZ`) and
then **verify that pad/bump coordinates land at identical absolute
positions** under the target tool's orientation-plus-anchor composition; do
not assume the mirror axes agree. `face_down` records a distinct mounting
intent whose geometric realization the format deliberately leaves to the
writer (spec, `orientation` section); it is left unmapped here for the same
reason: an exporter that needs it must pin an explicit composition and
verify pad positions.

### 6.4 Physical thickness has one source

A die's physical thickness is `dimensions.thickness`, always. Visualization
stackups (render slabs, display-only substrate heights) are aesthetic and
must never leak into an exported model.

## 7. Reverse direction (3Dblox -> `.chiplet`), informative

Coarse and of limited use: a `.chiplet` derived from 3Dblox has no GDS/OASIS
bodies, no metallurgy, and no DRC parameters, so it feeds neither a
mask-level viewer nor an assembly-DRC flow - it is a placement skeleton to be
enriched by hand. The forward direction is the productive one.

## 8. Source-of-truth rule

One assembly, one authoritative placement source. The `.chiplet` file is
authoritative for placement and z-mounting; a `.3dbx` produced by the mapping
in section 5 is a **derived export artifact**, regenerated rather than
edited. A project may record the export step in the opaque `flow` block. The
only proposed schema hook is the component-level
[`3dblox_ref`](./CHIPLET_FORMAT_SPEC.md#3dblox_ref-proposed-extension); an
assembly-level `.3dbx` reference is deliberately not proposed.
